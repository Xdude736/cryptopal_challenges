/*
 * Author: Xdude736
 * Program: hex2base64
 * Purpose: Given an input stream of hexidecimal values, with no spaces, convert it into properly formatted base64 output to the console
 * Algorithm: 
 *        1.) Read input as a command line argument
 *        2.) Take the input two characters at a time and map to the appropriate hex value i.e. '4' and '2' from the console becomes 0x42
 *        3.) Process the hex and perform bitwise operations on the raw bytes in order to get the appropriate bse64 values
 *        4.) Print the base64 output to the console
